transpile-dash-to-python

## Description
`transpile-dash-to-python` is a Python script that helps you transpile shell-like commands to Python code. It is a simple utility that converts commands written in the shell scripting syntax to equivalent Python code. However, please note that the tool is not yet complete and may not handle all shell commands or edge cases. It currently supports basic functionality but still lacks some features.

## Usage
To use `transpile-dash-to-python`, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. Run the script `trans.py` with your desired shell-like command as an argument:

```
python3 trans.py ?.sh
```

Please replace `?.sh` with the actual shell-like command you want to transpile to Python code.

And to use the demo, run 

```
dash demoRun.sh 01 args
```

you can write your own demo to test the trans

to use the test, run 

```
dash test??.sh
```

Reminder need to test on a Unix-based system

## Current Limitations
As mentioned before, the tool is a work in progress and may not fully cover all shell commands and features. It currently lacks support for the following:

1. Arithmetic operations using `$((...))`, such as 
    ```
    echo $((x  + y))
    ```
2. Redirection operators `<`, `>`, and `>>`, such as:
    ```
    echo hello >file
    echo world >> file
    cat <file
    ```
3. Logical operators `&&` and `||`.
4. `test` case of `-o` and so on
5. `case`
6. most of the globbing like `?.sh`
7. others
